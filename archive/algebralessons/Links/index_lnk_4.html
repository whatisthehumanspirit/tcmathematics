c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Algebraic Properties
</H4>
<P>

All algera texts include a discussion of the basic algebraic properties, however these will play a larger role in our continuing discussion than is typical.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first state each and then give some attention to how they will be important in our continuing discussion.

i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additive Identity and Additive Inverse
</H5>
<P>

The Additive Identity then is a number that can be added to any other number without changing its value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this book, we will always be referring to this number as zero, 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of note that not all number sets have such a number though.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be discussed in the section on number groups.<br><br>The Additive Inverse is the number that can be added to another to sum to zero, the additive identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the two concepts by which this book differs vastly from a regular first year algebra book.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be employing the concept of an additive identity throughout our discussion to eliminate subtraction from our equation solving and expression simplifying that we will be doing throughout our discussion of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;Said briefly here, instead of subtracting, we will always add the opposite of the number.&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a general idea of why this works, lets look at the
