d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Number Groups
</H4>
<P>

There are some important properties that we would like to see number sets have.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number set is closed under an operation if performing that operation on any two numbers in the set gives another number in the set.
</P>

<H5>

i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The counting numbers are a relatively uninteresting group of numbers as they have none of the properties that make number sets interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the record, these are the numbers with which most people learn to count.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Counting Numbers</B> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}<br>Under which of the four operations are the counting numbers closed?&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little effort it should be obvious that the counting numbers are closed under addition and multiplication but not under subtraction or division.&nbsp;&nbsp;That they are not closed under subtraction can be seen by subtracting any number from itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is 0, and the counting numbers do not include the number 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing one counting number by a number larger that itself will yield a number that is less than 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that the smallest number in this set is 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the counting numbers are not closed under division either.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certainly counting numbers that, under division or subtraction, yield another counting number, however, for a number set to be closed, we must be able to perform the operation on any two numbers in the set and always get another number from the set.
</P>


<H5>

ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The whole numbers are a much more interesting group of numbers, specifically the ideas behind their divisibility is a important stepping stone in the discussion of factoring polynomials.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be discussed in Chapter 10 on Number Theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to perform the basic arithmetic operations on whole numbers is certainly prerequisite to the study of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, one should be very comfortable adding subtracting, multiplying and dividing whole numbers before continuing on in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no discussion of these concepts in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of whole numbers is listed below and is simply the counting numbers but including the number 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Whole Numbers</B> {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}<br>Under which of the four operations is the set of whole numbers closed?&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the whole numbers are not closed under either addition or subtraction, however it does have an additive identity.
</P>


<H5>

iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Integers
</H5>
<P>

The integers are the first really interesting number set that we will address in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Integers are an incredibly important concept to master as the rules that we will use for integers will be the rules that govern the rest of our discussion of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of integers is composed of the positive and negative whole numbers including zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of immediate note that the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication, but also subtraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the integers contain both an additive and multiplicative identity as well as additive inverses for all numbers in the set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is a list of the integers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Integers (÷½)</B> = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}<br>The next chapter will have a thorough discussion on how to correctly perform the arithmetic operations on integers as well as some good ways to understand these on a number line or with integer chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules however apply to all numbers sets from integers to complex numbers and even to polynomials although these are more difficult to handle.
</P>

iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rational Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The rational numbers are the first set of numbers that are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are however a little more difficult to list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the following is a definition of the rational numbers.<br><br><B>Definition of Rational Numbers (Q)</B><br><br>A number, n, is a rational number if it can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n is rational if it can be written as <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_8.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_8.gif]"  WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30"  ALIGN="absmiddle" > where <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_9.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_9.gif]"  WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" ><br><br>Rational numbers are more commonly referred to as fractions, although we must remember that fractions include numbers that are larger than zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many decimals are also rational numbers because they also can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, any decimal that terminates (ends) or repeats, can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to integers, the next chapter will contain a brief discussion on changing numbers from fractional to decimal form and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we will comment on mixed numbers and improper fractions.
