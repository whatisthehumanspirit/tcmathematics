i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplifying Algebraic Expression
</P>
<P>

<br>Although there is much more to simplifying algeraic expressions, this discusion is ample for the next few chapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not, for now, going to allow powers on variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, an algebraic expression may contain variable terms and constant terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplifying then is a matter of collecting together the costants to find one value and collecting variable terms together by their variable.<br><br>This is the first time we will make use of our properties. ADD Inv:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mult Inv:<br><br>From this point forth, we will first eliminate subtraction and division from our equations when dealing with constants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that what we referred to as collecting like terms is actuallly using the distributive property in reverse.<br><br>However, this step is typically omitted in favor of simply adding the coeffients and calling it collecting like terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly I bring up this point to quickly justify why we do this the way we do.

ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluating Expressions When Variables&#8217; Value is Known
</P>
<P>

The process I am about to discuss is one of the most important thus far as it will serve as our primary and most fundamental means of checking solutions throughout algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that evaluate means to follow through the order of operations until we arrive at a single numerical value.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important concept to understandthat if two things are equal, one can be replaced by the other in an expression without changing the value of that expression.
