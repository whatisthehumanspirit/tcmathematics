Method for Multiplying (and Dividing) Rational Numbers
</H3>

<a name="Multiplying Rationals"></a><a name="Multiplying Rationals" >
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Change all division to multiplication by the reciprocal (<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a title="Properties.nb" >Multiplicative Inverse</a></FONT>)<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce each rational in your product to lowest terms.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross cancel common factors from numerators and denominators of factors.<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The product of the numerators over the product of the denominators is the product.<br>*assuming all possible reduction and cross canceling was done in step three, your product will be fully reduced but it never hurts to double check.</P>
