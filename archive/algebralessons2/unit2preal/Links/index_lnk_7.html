iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rational Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The rational numbers are the first set of numbers that are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are however a little more difficult to list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the following is a definition of the rational numbers.<br><br><B>Definition of Rational Numbers (Q)</B><br><br>A number, n, is a rational number if it can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n is rational if it can be written as <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_17.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_17.gif]"  WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="30"  ALIGN="absmiddle" > where <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_18.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_18.gif]"  WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" ><br><br>Rational numbers are more commonly referred to as fractions, although we must remember that fractions include numbers that are larger than zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many decimals are also rational numbers because they also can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, any decimal that terminates (ends) or repeats, can be written as a ratio of integers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to integers, the next chapter will contain a brief discussion on changing numbers from fractional to decimal form and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we will comment on mixed numbers and improper fractions.
