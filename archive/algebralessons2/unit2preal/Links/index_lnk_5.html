ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The whole numbers are a much more interesting group of numbers, specifically the ideas behind their divisibility is a important stepping stone in the discussion of factoring polynomials.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be discussed in Chapter 10 on Number Theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to perform the basic arithmetic operations on whole numbers is certainly prerequisite to the study of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, one should be very comfortable adding subtracting, multiplying and dividing whole numbers before continuing on in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no discussion of these concepts in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of whole numbers is listed below and is simply the counting numbers but including the number 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Whole Numbers</B> {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}<br>Under which of the four operations is the set of whole numbers closed?&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the whole numbers are not closed under either addition or subtraction, however it does have an additive identity.
