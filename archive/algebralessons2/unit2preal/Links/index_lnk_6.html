iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Integers
</H5>
<P>

The integers are the first really interesting number set that we will address in this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Integers are an incredibly important concept to master as the rules that we will use for integers will be the rules that govern the rest of our discussion of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;The set of integers is composed of the positive and negative whole numbers including zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of immediate note that the set of integers is closed under addition and multiplication, but also subtraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the integers contain both an additive and multiplicative identity as well as additive inverses for all numbers in the set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is a list of the integers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Integers (÷½)</B> = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...}<br>The next chapter will have a thorough discussion on how to correctly perform the arithmetic operations on integers as well as some good ways to understand these on a number line or with integer chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules however apply to all numbers sets from integers to complex numbers and even to polynomials although these are more difficult to handle.
