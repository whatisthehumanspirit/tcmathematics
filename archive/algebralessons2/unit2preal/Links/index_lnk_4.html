d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Number Groups
</H4>
<P>

There are some important properties that we would like to see number sets have.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number set is closed under an operation if performing that operation on any two numbers in the set gives another number in the set.

i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting Numbers
</H5>
<P>

The counting numbers are a relatively uninteresting group of numbers as they have none of the properties that make number sets interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the record, these are the numbers with which most people learn to count.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Counting Numbers</B> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}<br>Under which of the four operations are the counting numbers closed?&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little effort it should be obvious that the counting numbers are closed under addition and multiplication but not under subtraction or division.&nbsp;&nbsp;That they are not closed under subtraction can be seen by subtracting any number from itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is 0, and the counting numbers do not include the number 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividing one counting number by a number larger that itself will yield a number that is less than 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that the smallest number in this set is 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the counting numbers are not closed under division either.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certainly counting numbers that, under division or subtraction, yield another counting number, however, for a number set to be closed, we must be able to perform the operation on any two numbers in the set and always get another number from the set.
