c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Algebraic Properties
</H4>
<P>

All algera texts include a discussion of the basic algebraic properties, however these will play a larger role in our continuing discussion than is typical.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first state each and then give some attention to how they will be important in our continuing discussion.
</P>

<H5>

i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additive Identity and Additive Inverse
</H5>
<P>

The Additive Identity is a number that can be added to any other number without changing its value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you think of such a number?
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Additive Identity">Additive Identity</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Additive Identity"></a><a name="Additive Identity" >
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Additive Identity, 0, is a number such that:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_8.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_8.gif]"  WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" > for all <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_9.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_9.gif]"  WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >
</P>
</a>
<P>

As we will be dealing with the Real numbers throughout this book, it will suffice to refer to this number as zero, 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy of note that not all number sets have such a number though.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Number System Contruction Activity.
</P>
<P>The Additive Inverse is the number that can be added to another to sum to the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Additive Identity">Additive Identity</a></FONT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Additive Inverse">Additive Inverse</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Additive Inverse"></a><a name="Additive Inverse" >
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given a number, <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_10.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_10.gif]"  WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >, the Additive Inverse is a number <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_11.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_11.gif]"  WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" > such that:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_12.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_12.gif]"  WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" > for all <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_13.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_13.gif]"  WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >.
</P>
</a>
<P>

We will be employing the concept of an additive identity throughout our discussion to eliminate subtraction from our equation solving and expression simplifying that we will be doing throughout our discussion of algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;Said briefly here, instead of subtracting, we will always add the opposite of the number.
</P>


<H5>

ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiplicative Identity and Multiplicative Inverse
</H5>
<P>

The Multiplicative Identity is a number by which any other can be muliplied without changing its value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you think of such a number?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Multiplicative ID Statement">Multiplicative Identity</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Multiplicative ID Statement"></a><a name="Multiplicative ID Statement" >
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Multiplicative Identity, 1, is a number such that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x &times; 1 = x for all x
</P>
</a>
<P>

Since we will be dealing with Real numbers throughout this course, it will suffice to call the Multiplicative Identity 1 but it is worthy of note that we could construct a number system where a different number has the property of not changing any other value under multiplication.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Number System Construction Activity.
</P>
<P>The Multiplicative Inverse is the number that, when multiplied by the original number, yields a product of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Multiplicative ID Statement">Multiplicative Identity</a></FONT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we will be dealing with the real number system and thus our Multiplicative Identity is 1, we can simplify this statement as follows:</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Multiplicative Inverse">Multiplicative Inverse</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Multiplicative Inverse"></a><a name="Multiplicative Inverse" >
<P>

Given a number x, the Multiplicative Inverse is a number <IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_14.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_14.gif]"  WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="18"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >such that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_15.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_15.gif]"  WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="18"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >
</P>
</a>
<P>This says that for any number, there is another, by which we can multiply the original to obtain a product of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Multiplicative ID Statement">Multiplicative Identity</a></FONT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As was the case with the Additive Inverse, we will be employing the concept of a Multiplicative Inverse to simplify our equation solving and expression simplifying processes by eliminating the need for division.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, division is multiplication by the reciprocal.</P>



<H5>

iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Commutative Property of Addition and Multiplication
</H5>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Commutative Property of Addition">Commutative Property of Addition</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Commutative Property of Addition"></a><a name="Commutative Property of Addition" >
<P>

For all numbers, a and b, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a + b = b + a
</P>
</a>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Commutative Property of Multiplication">Commutative Property of Multiplication</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Commutative Property of Multiplication"></a><a name="Commutative Property of Multiplication" >
<P>

For all numbers, a and b,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a &times; b = b &times; a
</P>
</a>
<P>

In words, these two properties state that the order in which we either add or multiply two numbers will not affect the final sum or product.
</P>


<H5>

iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;Associative Property of Addition and Multiplication
</H5>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Associative Property of Addition">Associative Property of Addition</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Associative Property of Addition"></a><a name="Associative Property of Addition" >
<P>

For all numbers, a, b and c, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
</P>
</a>
<P>

In words,the addition version says that when we are finding the sum of three numbers,we can sum the first two and then add the third or we can add the first to the sum of the second and third.In either case,our final sum will be the same.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Associative Property of Multiplication">Associative Property of Multiplication</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Associative Property of Multiplication"></a><a name="Associative Property of Multiplication" >
<P>

For all numbers, a, b and c,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a &times; b) &times; c = a &times; (b &times; c)
</P>
</a>
<P>

Similarly, the multiplication version states that when finding the product of three numbers, we can either multiply the product of the first two with the third or multiply the first by the product of the second and third.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product in both cases will be the same.
</P>


<H5>

v.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributive Property
</H5>
<P>

Like the Commutative and Associative properties, the Distributive Property has two versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike all of our previous rules though, each of the Distributive Property's versions involve multiple operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it offers us a far less subtle result.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition">Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition"></a><a name="Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition" >
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all numbers a, b and c,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a &times; (b + c) = a &times; b + a &times; c
</P>
</a>
<P>

In words, this says when multiplying a sum by a number, we may first sum and then multiply or we can multiply each of the sum's addends by the number and then sum the two products.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><a href="#Distributive Property of Exponents over Multiplication">Distributive Property of Exponents over Multiplication</a></FONT></P>


<a name="Distributive Property of Exponents over Multiplication"></a><a name="Distributive Property of Exponents over Multiplication" >
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all numbers a, b and c,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../Images/index_gr_16.gif"  BORDER="0"  ALT="[Graphics:../Images/index_gr_16.gif]"  WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="17"  ALIGN="absmiddle" >
</P>
</a>
<P>

This property states that when raising a product to a power, we may instead raise each of the factors to that power and find the product of these two exponential term or find the product and then raise it to the power.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>
